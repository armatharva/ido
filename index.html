                                <p>This is probably premenstrual syndrome or PMS. Right before your period, your hormones drop and this may cause sadness, anger, anxiety. You can try journaling, talking to someone, and light exercise such as walking or stretching. If you're concerned, mention it to a physician; it could be PMDD which is a more extreme situation, but something that can be treated.</p>

                                <p>It's okay as an extremely short-term solution, but it will not absorb well and will deteriorate. Change it often and switch to a pad or clean cloth as quickly as possible.</p>

                                <p>If you can't change your pad often, putting a thin layer of petroleum jelly (if you have it) onto the skin will reduce friction. Wearing loose clothes also facilitates air circulation.</p>
